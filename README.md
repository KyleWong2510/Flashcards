# Flashcards

## Abstract
Flashcards is a game meant to test the user's knowledge on code-related questions.  It is meant to be used as a study guide and can be played completely in the command line.  If the user gets less than 90% correct, they must start over and answer questions until they succeed.  Once finished, the user is presented with a report card showing the questions they missed, the correct answers, and how many times they attempted to answer.  Follow the set up instructions below to get started!
